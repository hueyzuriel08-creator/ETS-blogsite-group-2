I enjoy gaming, going to the gym, and participating in different sports. I am most passionate about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which I have trained in for four years. Through dedication and hard work, I won two silver medals in the International ASJJF Juvenile White Featherweight Division. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu helps me stay disciplined, focused, and cope with stress in a healthy way. It has taught me perseverance, self-control, and confidence, which I apply in my daily life and studies.','https://i.postimg.cc/dtKqS4hH/member1.jpg')">

Welcome to my autobiography, My name is Ryne Gerard Intes, or you can simply call me Rin for short, I’m 16 years old & I live in the country of the Philippines. My interests & hobbies lie in listening to music (specifically Japanese songs & EDM although I do have a varied taste in music.), IEMS, Scenery, taking a stroll in places I find soothing, & Mechanical Keyboards. Although I’m not the type of person to be an overachiever, underachiever or achiever in general, I can I do have a few examples are: Granted a loyalty award in my alma mater ever since my preschool years & potentially next year, because I won’t switch schools till I get that among other reasons. Earning an Honor Award last year for my troubles. If there are experiences I can list as memorable it’s definitely going to Japan in April 2024, Befriending & bonding together with a new close friend of mine, lastly the year of mid to late 2025 & current year.','https://i.postimg.cc/6Q7qNTBK/image.png')">

I have different hobbies/talents that I barely show off nowadays like traditional and digital art, dancing, and singing. These talents of mine are honed in my previous school, FAA. Although I wasn\'t able to finish my junior high school years in FAA, UIC still has given me the same opportunities that I will be forever be grateful to experience. I\'m an inconsistent honor student, but I still try to keep a good academic progress throughout my student journey. Many factors slow me down in achieving my goals, but the support of those I care deeply about helps me strive to do my best.',

  <h2>Post #4: Reflection on ICT</h2>

  <!-- Queende's general reflection -->
  <p><strong>Queende:</strong> "ICT has become the backbone of modern life, connecting people, information, and opportunities. In my life and chosen professional track, it empowers efficiency, creativity, and innovation, allowing us to solve problems faster, communicate seamlessly, and stay relevant in an ever-evolving digital world."</p>

  <p><strong>Huey:</strong> "ICT plays a vital role in how we communicate, learn, and solve problems. In my life, it connects me to information and people instantly, while in my chosen career, it enhances efficiency, innovation, and professional growth."</p>

  <p><strong>Riza:</strong> "ICT is a technology that allows people and organizations to interact with the digital world. It can influence me by providing much easier access to online platforms such as social media platforms (Facebook), marketplace platforms (Shopee) for entertainment, and Learning Management Systems (Google Classroom) for educational purposes."</p>

  <p><strong>Myllie:</strong> "As a continuation of the first semester’s MIL (Media and Information Literacy) lessons, ETS (Empowerment Technologies) further enhances our media literacy to ensure safer and more responsible access to different online media. The subject focuses on discussing various gadgets, websites, applications, and the World Wide Web, helping us understand how technology works and how it can be used effectively and wisely in daily life."</p>

  <p><strong>Ryne:</strong> "The essence of ICT is dynamic and interconnected, enabling individuals, transforming societies, and reinterpreting fields such as psychology. For middle-class individuals, it provides independence but requires awareness to avoid excessive dependence. It fuels innovation in society while revealing weaknesses. For psychologists, it expands perspectives but requires a reevaluation of ethics. In the end, ICT showcases human creativity, encouraging us to use it thoughtfully to promote fair, compassionate futures."</p>

  <p><strong>Shyne:</strong> "The blog helped me understand not only the atomic models but also the value of progress, improvement, and collaboration in the world of science."</p>

  <p><strong>Kyle:</strong> "ICT is a powerful force shaping every part of our world. In my daily life, it keeps me connected to loved ones and helps me learn new things. For our society here in Davao City, it improves access to services, supports local businesses, and spreads vital information though we must address the digital divide. As a HUMSS-Communication student, ICT is at the heart of my work, letting me create content, collaborate with others, and amplify community voices. Ultimately, ICT is both a tool and a bridge to build meaningful connections."</p>
